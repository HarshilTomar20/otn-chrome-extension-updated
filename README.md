# Flow

- The chrome extension is a React + TypeScript codebase
- The `public` folder contains a `manifest.json` file which provides metadata about the extension, such as its name, version, and permissions
- When running `npm run build`, a `dist` folder is generated, which will also include the compiled `manifest.json` file
